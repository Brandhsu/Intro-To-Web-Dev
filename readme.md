# Intro

The technological limitations of computers, browsers 
and internet speed a decade ago resulted in a system where a vast 
majority of websites were made up of links, text, and the occasional 
image.

Ten years ago, we could never create apps and "experiences" on 
the web since slow internet speeds meant that you could never 
transfer media assets such as videos, images, and 3d models. 
Weak computing power (compared to today) meant that you could 
not run computationally expensive programs and newly developed 
browsers running on these computers meant that the languages/frameworks 
these browsers depended on did not support a wide range of actions.

Today, websites are no longer limited to being just static sites. 

# What can I do using web technologies?


# What will we learn?

I'll admit I may have hyped you up a lil' bit but it's important to 
understand truly how much potential the web has.

Here, we'll go over the basics of web development, writing a simple 
web app using HTML/CSS and adding functionality with Javascript.
