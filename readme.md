# What is this?

HackUCI-Demo is the source code for the intro to web development 
workshop for HackUCI 2019. The workshop will involve a live code demo 
to create a basic todo app that cover the following basics:

 * What is HTML? and how do we write it?
 * What is CSS? and how do we write it?
 * What is JS? and how do we write it?
 
 * What is React? and how do we write it?

There's a lot of background information here so if you want to skip to 
the code, go straight [here](#where-to-start)

# Intro

![Yahoo in 2001](./assets/yahoo-old.png)

The technological limitations of computers, browsers 
and internet speed a decade ago resulted in a system where a vast 
majority of websites were made up of links, text, and the occasional 
image.

Ten years ago, we could never create apps and "experiences" on 
the web since slow internet speeds meant that you could never 
transfer media assets such as videos, images, and 3d models. 
Weak computing power (compared to today) meant that you could 
not run computationally expensive programs and newly developed 
browsers running on these computers meant that the languages/frameworks 
these browsers depended on did not support a wide range of actions.

Today, websites are no longer limited to being just static sites. 

# What is web development?

Web development encompasses everything relating to creating 
websites and applications for the World Wide Web. 

# Terms to Understand

I'll be teaching Front-end development and then we'll go over how to connect 
your front-end to the back-end. But first, we need to understand the terms I'll 
using.

![Front-end vs. Back-end infographic](./assets/frontendvsbackend.png)

| Term             | Definition  |
|------------------|-------------|
| Web Dev          | Development of applications for the Web |
| Web Technologies | The technology available today that we can do web dev with. For example, WebGL is a library that simplifies developing complex 3d applications for the browser.          |
| Front-End/Client | The presentation layer of an app. This usually refers to the website and how it looks to the user - therefore, "presentation".                                              |
| Back-End/Server  | The backend is where the business logic runs. For example, looking at a site like an [online integral calculator](https://www.integral-calculator.com/), The front-end would be the form to accept and parse a user input and then it would send the user input to the backend - which is a server that does the actual integral calculation and sends it back to the client. |
| Full-Stack       | Front-End + Back-End. For example, a full-stack developer is capable of developing a front-end interface and setting up and maintaining the backend servers that run the main logic.           |


# What can I do using web technologies?

[Interactive 3d falling pasta](https://alteredqualia.com/three/examples/webgl_pasta.html) - 
If this doesn't convince you, I don't know what will

[Basic 2d Games (Agar.io)](https://agar.io/) - Pretty popular in 2016

[Car Demo](https://vr.ff.com/us/) - Really high quality car simulator

[Infinitown](https://demos.littleworkshop.fr/infinitown) - Procedurally generated 
infinite city

[Desmos Graphing Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) - Every high school
/college student knows this.

... and very obviously, every single website you've ever seen.

The short answer to what can you do with web technologies is really just 
everything that you would normally see as an app or downloadable software.

## Then, why the web if we can do it natively as an app/software

If someone asked you to check out an app, would you be more inclined to download 
it from the app store or just open up the website? And thus, our first point of contention -

### 1. Ease of Access

Why look for an app and download it just to try it when you can just click a 
link your friend sends you?

### 2. Cross-Platform

iOS, OSX, Android, Window, and pretty much every other user-friendly system that 
exists has a **browser** (Firefox, Chrome, IE, Edge) that executes the exact same 
html/css/js code and produces *nearly* the same results. 

However, if you were to develop natively, here's the general list:

* iOS - Swift, (maybe Obj-C)
* OSX - Swift, Obj-C, C++, Java, etc.
* Windows - C++, Java, etc.
* Android - Java, Kotlin

And don't forget, just because you can write a desktop application in C++, you 
still need to compile them into separate executables - one for OSX and one for 
Windows. In the case of mobile development, you HAVE to learn 2 separate 
languages + programming paradigms: Swift for iOS and Java for Android. But as you 
probably know, you can access the same website on both phones.

## CONS

Obviously, if web dev was all this without cons, it would be used all the time so here 
are a few cases in which you would NOT write software with just web technologies.

* Graphics intensive games - This is the most obvious one since they require huge 
computing power but you might see this gap close in the future:

(You might say well there's no way you can play Witcher 3 on high settings in
the browser - but then you see people [running Unreal Engine 4 in the browser](https://epiclearningresources.000webhostapp.com/ActionRPG/ActionRPG-HTML5-Shipping.html))

*Note*: obviously the above link requires a decently good computer to run so don't try that 
on your 2012 mobile phone running safari.

* servers, databases, etc. - When you do front-end development, you're not writing most, 
if not any, of the business logic. For example, if you're a bank, you will NOT be writing 
the code to deal with transferring money from one account to another. Rather, you will 
be designing a form and buttons that tells your backend what the user wants to do.


We won't get to writing some intense 3d gameplay in the browser but hopefully, 
you'll have enough here to get started on your journey into web-dev.

# Where to start?

This repo contains the source code for the todo app example that I will live code 
to teach fundamental web-development. 

The file structure of this repo looks like this (with some files not included for simplicity)

| File/Folder     | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| README.md       | That's this you're reading right now. Just a note to display on the Github repo |
| extensions.txt  | Here are all the extensions I'm using that are relevant to the demo. They are available on VSCode and you can search them up in the extensions search bar to install them.|
| final           | Source code for app written in plain html/css/js |
| final-commented | Same as above however, almost ever line is commented to help you understand what it does |
| react-final     | Source code for app written in React. |
| LICENSE         | MIT License. Don't really worry about it. It's to make this open source so anyone can take this code. This only applies to those using this repo to teach others, I would like for you to link to this repo. |


Some of the above are folders. Those folders will have README.md files that 
explain the contents of those inner files/folders so don't worry.

The relevant ones are [final, final-commented, and react-final]
