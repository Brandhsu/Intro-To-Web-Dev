# Intro to Front-End Frameworks

If you just want to dive into the code, start [here.](#where-to-start)

What we did earlier was create a simple todo app in html/css 
and implement the basic functionality in Javascript. What we 
are going to do next is implement this exact same app in React. 

But before we do that, you might be asking yourself why do we 
need to do this app with a framework since the code we just 
wrote worked just fine? Or maybe what the heck is a framework?

## Why frameworks?

When you develop many applications from scratch, you'll find that 
within each project, you will repeat most of the same code. In 
addition to having a mostly similar boilerplate code, you will also 
notice that you will be designing multiple webpages that all look 
somewhat similar. 

Frameworks also are designed with a certain architecture in mind so 
not only are you saving time in not duplicating code, you're also 
saving time not designing the system.

There are several front-end frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, 
Svelte, jQuery, and so many more..) and each have their own pros 
and cons.

After writing, we should be able to see the immediate benefits 
of a front-end framework and how learning atleast one can 
be useful for rapid prototyping.

# Why React?

React is by far the most popular framework. Being popular in and of 
itself is a reason to use React. This means that there's tons of 
support, libraries, and tutorials out there.

1. Simplicity - it's easy to learn and understand.
2. Performant - the virtual dom structure often gives it better 
performance
3. Native - React Native allows you to develop native apps as well

These are just the reasons to pick React over other frameworks so 
benefits that frameworks share are not listed.

# Where to start?

If this is your first time writing React, you will need to install 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

*Note* This app was started using [create-react-app.](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) and it's highly recommended 
for starting new React projects.

create-react-app will produce a similar structure as the one we have 
right now so keep that in mind when you want to start a new project 
from scratch.

The file structure for our project looks mostly like this.

```bash
├── README.md
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── manifest.json
│   └── robots.txt
└── src
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── components
    │   ├── App
    │   │   ├── App.css
    │   │   └── App.js
    │   ├── Header
    │   │   ├── Header.css
    │   │   └── Header.js
    │   └── TodoList
    │       ├── TodoList.css
    │       └── TodoList.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
```

| File/Folder name  | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| README.md         | That's this you're reading right now. Just a note to display on the Github repo |
| package.json      | This contains the 'metadata' for the source code of your project. It tells us which dependencies (libraries that we use) are included and other useful information about a certain project. The data is structure in a JSON format which makes it fairly readable and easy to understand. |
| package-lock.json | This is similar to the package.json but this file is automatically generated and has information on exactly which versions of each dependency I'm running. We won't be touching this at all so don't worry too much about it. |
| public            | The folder that holds all the files that will be hosted publicly. This will be our assets such as images and videos, favicons, html, and anything else that should be public. |
| src               | Here is where we do most of our coding. All of our source files will be here and then compiled into a final build folder that gets hosted online. |
| components        | There is no standard for how we organize our code. However, there is a common design pattern that we put all of our components inside a components folder. I like to then put every component as well as their stylesheets into another folder. You can see how I put the code for the Header component and all of it's relevant files into it's own folder. |
