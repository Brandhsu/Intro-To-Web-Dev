# Intro to Web Frameworks
What we did earlier was create a simple todo app in html/css 
and implement the basic functionality in Javascript. What we 
are going to do next is implement this exact same app in React. 

After writing, we should be able to see the immediate benefits 
of a front-end framework and how learning atleast one can 
be useful for rapid prototyping.

There are several front-end frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, 
Svelte, jQuery, and so many more..) and each have their own 
unique properties.
